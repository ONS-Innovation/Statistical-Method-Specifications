## 3.0 Summary

Selective Editing is an internationally recognised editing method
where potential errors are prioritised according to their expected 
effect on key outputs. Only respondents that are having an impact
on published estimates will be recontacted.

Selective Editing works by assigning a score to each important 
variable for a business where, the score reflects the impact that 
editing the respondent will have on the estimates. Only contributors
with a high score are checked, low scoring contributors pass 
through unchecked.

## 4.0 Assumptions

- All data inputs required by the method are available and are on a
  standardised basis.
- The auxiliary variable should be a good predictor of the target
  variable.
- The predicted value in the score calculaiton must have been cleaned
  and free from errors. This is not limited to genuine returns and 
  it may be an imputed or constructed value if a clean response is
  not available.
- Each respondent is clearly classified into one mutually exclusive
  domain group.
- The thresholds specified are valid and appropriate (>0)
- If the "weighted mean score" is selected to combine score, then the
  sum of the weights provided should total to 1.
